# CSCS240-JavaScript-Week-7

In this project, you will use regular expressions to verify that a password passes validation before it is accepted. In this web form, all proposed passwords must (1) be at least eight characters long, (2) have at least one uppercase letter, (3) have at least one digit, and (4) have at least one of the following symbols !, @, #, or $. If the password fails validation, a message indicating the reason for failure should appear in the web form.
